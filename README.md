# CSE Projetcs
Projects from Computer Science
1. Linked List Operations
Implemented a program to read integers from a file into a linked list, calculate their sum, and manage memory efficiently.

2. Insertion Sort
Developed a program to read integers into an array, sort them using the insertion sort algorithm, and measure execution time.

3. Sorting Comparison
Compared the performance of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort on integer arrays, analyzing execution time for both algorithms.

4. Quick Sort Analysis
Implemented Quick Sort with various pivot strategies, tested performance over multiple runs, and calculated average runtime.

5. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Built a program to compute the shortest paths in a graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm, leveraging an adjacency matrix for graph representation.

6. Hash Table for Champions
Designed a hash table to store and manage game champion data, allowing efficient searching, addition, and deletion of records.
